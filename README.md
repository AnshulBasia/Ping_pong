The game can have maximum four players where each player guards her wall from the ball. If the ball touches the playerâ€™s wall 3 times, the player is deemed as dead and her paddle is removed from the game board. This is a continuous action game; even if a player misses the ball, the ball continues to move on the game board. Some players in the game can be manual, and some can be backed by the computer (different difficulty levels: easy/medium/hard). The player who remains alive at the end of the game is deemed as the winner. 



This is a basic ping pong game. There is only one ball which moves in a random direction at the start of the game. The game board is in 2D and the paddles can move left and right (or up and down) along a side only.
